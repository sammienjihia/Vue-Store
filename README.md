> A Store Management App

## Task
To demonstrate your knowledge of VueJS, you will be required to develop a store management application (Single page app). 

Authentication
- Login and logout of the system with JWT

Item Management
- Add items to the store
- View details of an item
- Edit an existing item
- Delete an existing item
- View all available items in the store
- Filter/Search items by name/category/price

Order Management
- Create an order
- Add an item to the cart/order
- Remove an item from the order
- Checkout 

Other than the above requirements, you are also required to include proper notification features for interactivity.

Your applications should be simple, good look and feel (crispy) and highly usable as well.


Note: API endpoints to login/logout users and check whether a user is logged in will be provided

This application should be implemented in VueJS. No persistence of data will be required, hence thereâ€™s no need to worry about saving the data in a database or any other data store mechanism. The application MUST demonstrate all major aspects of VueJS including:

- Components 
- Directives 
- Computed Properties
- Filters 
- Mixins
- Routing
- Form Input Bindings
- Element UI
- Testing
